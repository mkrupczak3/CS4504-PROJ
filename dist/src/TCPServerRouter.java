    // and creating threads for each connection. It also creates a routing
    // table for the TCP Client/Server to use.

    // Here, Java has already provided an Object with optional methods for adjusting the behavior.
    Socket clientSocket = null; // socket for the thread. Thomas. Client refers to both TCPclient and TCPserver.

    // specific process to which an incoming network message is to be delivered while a socket is
    // an endpoint for communication.

    // possibly returns a result to the requester.
